	Rules for a great commit message

http://git-school.github.io/visualizing-git/
	run git commit, etc and it will visualize it



-----
git status
	show repository status

git status -s
	show short list of status
	column 1 -- staged
	column 2 -- modified
	column 3 -- file name

	You can have a file show up in cols 1 & 2. For instance
	MM git-stuff.txt
		this means the file was changed and 'add' to staged
		but then modified again after that

git log
	show log of commits

git log -<<number>>
	restrict output to a specific number of commits

git log -stat
	show files and their last commit (like svn status)

git log --oneline
  one line per commit


git add
	moves file from new/modified to staged

git log --patch
	shows everything -- can be scrolled up/down

git rm <<filename>>
	remove file and stop tracking status

git rm --cached <<filename>>
	stop tracking the file

git mv <<current-filename>> <<new-filename>>

git checkout -b <<branch name>>
	create a new branch and checkout to it
	do just "git branch" if you want to create a branch but not switch to it

Branches - use git status to see which branch you're on

[[[[[[[[[
Try these in visualizer to see how branching and HEAD develop/move around
git commit
git commit
git checkout -b new_branch
git commit
git commit
git checkout master
git commit
git commit
git checkout new_branch
git commit
]]]]]]]]]

git stash
	save working state of branch and 'stash' it so that your changed stuff won't interfere with commits
	git stash pop
		restores your stashed stuff

git merge <<branch>
	merges <<branch>> into the current checked out branch/master


git reset --soft
  move commits back into staging area

git reset  (or git reset --mixed)
  moves commits back to working directory

git reset --hard
  moves commits to trash

	% git log --oneline
